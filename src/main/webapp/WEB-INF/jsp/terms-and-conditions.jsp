                     <p>Usairling does not act as principal but makes arrangements with third-party vendors, such as, but not limited to airlines, tour operators , suppliers and consolidators.</p>
                     <p>By using this Site, you acknowledge that the rates offered by Usairling and affiliate companies are a result of negotiation between Usairling and the Travel Suppliers and include certain fees retained by them for their services, taxes and other charges. When booking with any Travel Supplier through this Site, you authorize Usairling and affiliate companies to book reservations or enter a contract on your behalf with Travel Suppliers for the total price displayed, including such fees and any applicable taxes or charges related to the Travel Supplier&#x27;s or Cheapoflightticket &#x27;s services.</p>
                     <p>Usairling shall not be liable for errors or inaccuracies on the Site, or the failure of Travel Suppliers from whom you obtain services through this Site, including but not limited to airlines, tour operators, suppliers and consolidators. Usairling , in providing travel management services, does not endorse, guarantee or insure the products or services which are provided by an external supplier, the financial position of such suppliers or the reimbursement to you from any loss as a result of the financial condition of such supplier. In the event that a supplier defaults prior to providing the service to you where a payment has been made, your sole recourse for a refund shall be the defaulting supplier, or from other responsible third party unless such loss was caused solely by Usairling. In those situations in which a supplier defaults prior to providing services you may pursue any recourse against the supplier for a refund, as permitted by law or statute.</p>
                     <p>Except as expressly stated herein, Usairling assumes no responsibility for actions relating to travel services beyond the control of Usairling or its employees. Usairling is not responsible or liable for any act, error, omission, injury, loss, accident, damage, delay, nonperformance, irregularity, or any consequence thereof, which may be occasioned through neglect, or default or any other act or inaction of any Travel Supplier. Usairling shall not be liable for any fluctuation in price or change in schedule or equipment or accommodations for any travel service, which occurs subsequent to booking and payment for such service. Usairling shall not be liable for any cancellation, overbooking, delay, re-routing, strike, any weather occurrence or governmental occurrence as it affects your travel reservation made with us. Usairling shall not be liable for the depiction of travel products and services made available by any supplier of travel products and services, including but not limited to photographs, listed amenities, ratings, and discounts</p>
                     <p>Usairling acts as a service that provides value added service to retail travel agents and consumers. Usairling has no control over and assumes no liability for the actions of the suppliers from whom it obtains travel products or services</p>
                     <p>Usairling shall not be liable for final currency conversion or rates when paid after a travel reservation is made with us for international travel products and services. You agree and acknowledge that currency rates vary and any quoted price on the Site in local currency is a guideline, and not binding on us or the Travel Supplier.</p>
                     <p>Once certain travel reservations are made and paid for they may be completely non-refundable or there may be a penalty involved in cancellation or seeking a refund from the supplier of travel products and services. Once tickets have been issued there may be a penalty involved for cancellations and refunds. We do not have control over printed prices on the tickets, although some tickets may have BT (bulk fare) printed on them, some may have a specific value on them, which may be different (lower or higher) than the fare collected.</p>
                     <p>Discounts offered may vary depending on a number of factors including airlines utilized, class of service, destination, time of year (low, mid or high season), advance notice provided, minimum stay requirements fulfilled and flight load.</p>

Please read the additional Terms &amp; Conditions provided by such Travel Supplier carefully. You hereby agree to be bound by all the Terms &amp; Conditions of purchase imposed by any Travel Supplier with whom you choose to contract, including, but not limited to, payment of all amounts when due and compliance with the Travel Supplier&#x27;s rules and restrictions regarding availability and use of fares, products, or services.

Such deposit is unrelated to any payment received by Usairling for your airline ticket booking.
